I’m a 4th-year mathematics student and machine learning researcher at the University of Toronto, with interests in graph theory, complex analysis, and computer vision. I have industry expirence as a data scientist. Outside of academia, I’m passionate about horseback riding and enjoying a good cup of coffee every morning. Feel free to reach out if you have a research idea you'd like to explore together!
