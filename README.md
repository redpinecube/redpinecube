*I’m a 4th-year mathematics student at the University of Toronto, with interests in partial differential equations, complex analysis, group theory, topology, and graph theory. I have experience in machine learning research and software development. Outside of academia, I’m passionate about horseback riding and enjoying a good cup of coffee every morning. Feel free to reach out if you have a research idea you'd like to explore together!*
