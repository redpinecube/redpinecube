<h5>
I’m a 4th-year Mathematics student at the University of Toronto, with interests in Partial Differential Equations, Complex Analysis, Group Theory, Topology, and Graph Theory.
I also have experience in applied machine learning research and software development. Outside of academia, I’m passionate about horseback riding and like enjoying a good cup of coffee. Feel free to reach out if you have a research idea you'd like to explore together!
